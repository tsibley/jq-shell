# jqi

A tiny interactive REPL (read-eval-print-loop), for [the excellent jq
program](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Use it for interactively exploring a JSON document (or set of documents), with
rich line editing, command history, and auto-paging of results.

No installation required.  Run it straight from a clone of the git repository
or copy the single `jqi` file into `/usr/local/bin/` or `~/bin/`.
